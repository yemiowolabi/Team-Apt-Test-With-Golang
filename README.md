# TeamApt Technical Test(WITH GOLANG)

**This golang project generates a summary report with the total number of phone numbers for each service provider.**

- This is similar to the java application in a previous repository, but this one was done with GO

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository 

- Run the code.

```
go run .
```

- The program copies the required phone numbers from the required website and saves it in a file called `Phonenumbers.txt`

- It then opens that file and generates a summary report based on it.
